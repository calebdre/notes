# Homosexuality in the US


### The beginning of the gay rights movement
- it branches off from the black civil rights movement
- gays like the ideas of the civil rights movement 
	+ that blacks want to not just assimilate into white culture, but they want to take pride in their identity 
	+ if black is beautiful, then gay is good
- gays want to go through the court system to earn rights
- from the women's movement - they adopt the reasoning that homosexuality in and of itself doesn't in any way make them a deviant of any kind. 
- marriage wasn't a priority because the institution of marriage was restrictive 

### How marriage becomes a possibility
- 1980s-90s show shifts in thinking in American culture
- public health problem. Aids
	+ no one ever talked about it, so it spread out of control
- in 90s, movies/tv shows start portraying gay people as human beings
- aids leads to the fight for gay marriage 
	+ gay couples didn't have any benefits when their spouses died. They want legal standing in their relationships
