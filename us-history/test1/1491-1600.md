# 1491-1600: Native American Civilization Before & After European Contact

> How did contact between Europeans and Native peoples transform Native American Societies?

- Before, there wasn't a lot of communication between societies. But when Europeans made contact w/ Native Americans, the continents began to unite into one global economy.

Why did Europeans begining to look beyond Africa for more sources of trade and wealthh?
- New martitime techniques and technologies
- there's something preventing them from trading with east Asia (the ottoman empire), so they need to find another way

Colubus and Spaniards arrive in Hispaniola (north coast of Haiti)
- Mission is to empower the spanish crown and find wealth
- convert souls for christianity

They find the Taino Indians
- they're both trying to figure out the outher's culture. They perform a type of exchange of ideas
- Columian exchange starts happening (first time where foreign things enter ecosystems)
    + native americans get the short end of the stick
    + Biology has the most devastating effect on Native Americans because they haven't been exposed to animals      that pass on diseases like the Europeans had

Decades later, the Taino Indians are wiped out almost completely
- 90% of Indians get killed because of disease
