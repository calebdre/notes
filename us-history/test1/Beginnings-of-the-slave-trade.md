# Beginnings of the Slave Trade , 2/3

## The growth and spread of slavery in the Americas
> What made slavery unique in the Americas?

#### What is slavery?
- under someone else's control w/o consent
- working against will
- a person is treated as a commodity
- a process of dehumanization (doing all this dehumanizes the person)

#### What made slavery in the Americas unique?
- slavery led to the growth of an interconnected global economy and a modern industrialized capitolist world
    + this is because african labor is directly connected to wealth in Europe
    + all the products produced in the Americas are raw materials, which requires industry to turn into final products
    + slavery of the americas leads to capitalism
- the middle passage
    + the routes ships made from Africa to America
    + is the purist form of domination in the history of slavery
    + was unique because it was such an absolute brutality against another person
    + Before the middle passage
        - where europeans come down to africa to buy prisoners of war for items that kingdom chiefs want.
    + conditions in the ships were terrible
- Slavery here is based on race
    + ideas of racism is created when slave trades buy/sell slaves
    + used to justify domination
    + europeans view the situation from their cultural background: they're christian so light (them) must be right so dark is bad. Also, they're not christian


## 1670s-1690s: the Terrible Transition
> What explains the transition that the colonies went through to rely on slaves  

> How does the creation of a slave society create a new artistocracy?

#### Since tobacco was the saving grace of colonies, they needed lots of labor to produce it
    + enslaving native americans was not an option
    + indentured servants were used at first, but this becomes a problem
        * when servants are freed, they are taxed, have no say in politics, get bad land.
        * they begin revolting against social elites
        * subjugating them won't work because they're englishmen too with basic rights
    + they can do tap into the triangle trade, but the investment price is steep (but it had benefits too)

#### A slave society creates a political artistocracy
    + slaveowners can establish their dominance by acts of violence against their slaves
    + other people are working for the slave-owner, so they have a lot of free time and become very well read - a political philosopher evem
