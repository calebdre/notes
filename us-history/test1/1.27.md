Background
- Puritans and Pilgrams (separatists) came
- John Winthrop tells puritans to build a 'city upon a hill' - they're going to be an example to everyone else

Roots of conflict
- English see the landscape in different ways than the natives
    + they thought that the puritans can build a 'city upon a hill' only if they conquered the land/people and transform the land
- The English wanted to transform the land, which meant displacing the indians.
    + they obtained the land by tricking the natives: making them sign treaties without them knowing or having them drunk
- English want to convert the indians
    + because it's God's will and it undermines and neutralizes their cultural/political power
    + this caused resentment between the natives - families with different beliefs broke up

Pequot War
- was the 9/11 for indians
    + so many people were killed unimaginably brutally - indians didn't fight wars like europeans did
- this violence was justified by christianity to the Europeans
