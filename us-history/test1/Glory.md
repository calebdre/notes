> Why did the soldiers fight (from both sides)? What did the war mean to them?

### What the black soldier thought the war was over
- (toward the begining scene when Robert Shaw just came back from Anteitem) Frederick douglas thinks forming a black regimine for the war was somethign that would give black people pride when all they had known before was degradation.
    + The war is about proving that they deserved rights too.
- When the main characters first get into a tent, one of them wonders when they're going to get the blue suits like the white soldiers because they're soldeirs now
    + They expect for their place in society rise due to their involvement in the army
- When the Union didn't send the black soldiers to battle, moral became low for them. they wanted too prove themselves.
- when shaw is talking privately to one of the soldiers, the soldier worries about what they will do after the war is over. they are fighitng the war for the embetterment of their own race - they don't want to be a part of the Union's patriotism. They just want to enjoy their freedom.
- the night before the men go into their last battle - wagner, one of the soldiers says to the rest "we men ain't we" signaling that they thought that they had proven that they were the men that the white soldiers were - that they exhibited the same virtues that men held. They had taken back the manhood that they were stripped of through the oppression of slavery. Now they were fighitng for their freedom through fighting for the civil war. The scene directly after this one affirms that sentiment - as they walk passed the other regimens, the other regimens cheer them on, acknowledging their newfound manhood.
