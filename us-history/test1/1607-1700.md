# 1/20 - The New World: The Settling of Virginia

> Why did the English decide to establish a colony in North America?  
> What was the nature of the relationship between the native Indians and the English settlers?  
> Why did the English's attempts to establish a colony almost fail? And what was the saving grace?

### Motivations for the English
- National Rivalries
    + England wanted to catch up with Spain who controlled most of the Americas
- Religious Rivalries
    + As Spain spreads Catholicism, England needs to spread their protestantism

### Jamestown established in 1607
- Virginia was great because it had 4 deep rivers that went inland and allowed for easy coming and going
- was a business venture made by weathly englishmen
- There were people of all kinds - rich gentlemen, skilled laborers, criminals/grunt workers

### Powhatan Indians
- Hunted and Fished
- Were always at war with other tribes
    + thought that if they could get favor with English, they could get weapons/techonology to 1up the other tribes

### Powhatan Confrontation
- English are there to stay, get rich off the land/resources, and spread christianity
    + point of conflict

- Cultures were different
    + indians didn't have fenced plots marked for agriculture
    + women worked the land
- byproduct of 2 different world views: european domineering vs indian peace

### Why colony almost failed
- constant warfare/bloodshed and tension w/ indians
- disease nearly wipes out the English bc they landed in brackish water (no clean drinking water) and near a swamp (disease-carrying mosquitoes in the summer)
- people who came have no skills to grow crops

### Saving grace of the colonies
- They started growing *Tobacco*
- important because people get addicted, making demand increase in Europe
- it's difficult to grow
    + Labor intensive (can't depend on Native Americans bc they know the land, have a different language, and are dying off)
        * they turned to English endentured servants
