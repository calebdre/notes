# The Civil War

> What was the civil war actually about according to the people who fought in it?

### Lincoln and the soldier
- Lincoln understands the war just as the soldiers did. He says the same things that they will say about the war after the war.

### The end of compromise
- compromise has always made the union stay together
  + 3/5 compromise
  + etc.
- But things escalating made tensions rise and compromise impossible
  + the caning of sumner
  + the Kansas-Nebraska act
  + Lincoln's election
- The expansion of slavery was the big problem
  + the south says that slavery is a state's rights

### Abraham Lincoln
- lacked charisma but was an intellectual and could speak/write eloquently
- wins election in 1860
- when he wins, the southerns think he's a radical republican who wants slavery abolished.
  + They think no one in the white house cares about what they want. Their existence was at risk.
- South Carolina succeeds, followed by other states, because of Lincoln's election
- His first words as president: he was not an abolishonist; he just wanted to stop its expansion.
  + ** at his inaugural address: his first and foremost goal is to maintain the union  (this is what the war was about for him)**

### The Civil War
- 1861 is when war breaks out.
- the south thinks that the war will be short, but Lincoln knows that it will be long

### The bloodiest war in American history: Antietam
- Bloodiest single day in American history
- September 1862
- Robert E. Lee tries to go to Virginia, but they're held up in Maryland
- First picture of the war

### The Emancipation Proclamation
- This document did not free the slaves - only the ones in the conferderacy
  + this was done in hopes that the freed slave would come and fight for the Union
  + runaway slaves could now come join the union army
- this also changed the perspective of the war
  + after the document was released, people began to understand that the war was no about preserving the union anymore - it was about slavery

### The Gettysburg Address
- Battle of Gettysburg marked the beginning of the end for the south
  + Lee tried to invade the north, but failed again
- The meaning of the war is shifted because of this speech
  + Lincoln says that the men who died will not have died in vain - that we will have a new birth of freedom
  + it is because of this document's circulation that caused Lincoln to want to create the 13th amendment
