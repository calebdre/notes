# The Growth of the Cotton Kingdom

> What led to the creation of the Cotton Kingdom?
> What led to the creation of the most profitable slave nation in the world? 

#### There would be no slavery without expansion to the west
+ the civil war was caused by trying to decide what would be the future of slavery and of the U.S. as it expanded westward
+ As slavery pushes west, what would be the character of the U.S.?

#### Indian Removal
- Native Americans occupy the richest soils and land and gold mines
- by 1830, policies start being put in place to remove Indians (by Andrew Jackson)
    + trail of tears started, forcing the Indians to march to western lands 

#### What pushes the farmers and others to move west?
- Tobacco production causes the land to erode, so crops can't grow
- So people want to grow cotton out west

#### Cotton is in high demand
- Europe wants cotton a lot
- the cotton gin makes growing cotton a lot more profitable

#### The effect of the Cotton Kingdom on slaves
- the sale and move of slaves from the east to the west is called the second middle passage
- The International Slave Trade got abolished
- slaves in Virginia were not needed anymore since the soil was eroded, so they sold them to people in the deep south
- internal slave trade starts to appear - cotton planters need slaves so they start buying and selling 
    + slave trader becomes a new job. Trapping and selling slaves comes a thing
- slaves would be sold individually, effectively breaking up families and familial networks
