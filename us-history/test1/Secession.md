# Sectionalism in the U.S.
> What events occur between 1820-1860 that leads some states to secede from the union? 

### Sectional tension is caused by westward expansion
- slave states, because it was so profitable, want to bring their slaves 

### Northerns fear about expansion of slavery
- Politically: if there are more slave states, then slave holders will have more power in congress - political power would be stripped from the north
- Economic: northern farmers who wanted to move out west wouldn't be able to compete with the slave labor. Jobs would be taken from them. 

#### Missouri Compromise (1820)
- slavery was being pushed west into Missouri, northerns wanted to abolish slavery in Missouri and southerns said no
- southerns don't like northerners trying to abolish slavery, so secession was used for the firs time
- Effects of Missouri compromise
    + Missouri is now admitted as a slave state
    + Main is admitted as a free state
    + as U.S. moves westward. slavery is not allowed north of the 36 30 line (below Missouri)
- very temporary

#### Kansas-Nebraska Act (1854)
- Signals the end of Compromise between the North and South 
- caused by transcontinental railroad between Kansas and Nebraska
- Effects
    + slavery is decided by popular sovereignty 
- it becomes a race to establish a gov't and populate the state. When people come, it becomes a bloodbath
- Kansas descends into chaos
- Republic Party is create in the aftermath of Kansas-Nebraska act
    + formed to take a stance against westward expansion of slavery

#### How the end of compromise manifested itself in congress 
- Charles Sumner says that there is a bloodbath in Kansas because of southerners hiring mercenaries to fight to make slavery there.
- Preston Brooks walks into Sumner's office and canes to almost death him
- Media takes the act and uses it as propaganda 
    + this is what slavery does to southern men
    + finally someone gave what the north was coming to them
