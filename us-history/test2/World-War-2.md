# The American Homefront during World War II

### Women in WWII
- Women are called to leave their home lives and go out to work for the war
- Women are not only working, but doing work that men did
- this makes women challenge the original idea of gender roles
- advertisers appeal to women so that they can join the war effort
	+ they appeal to their femininity, patriotism, and emotions
- advertising changes how women are viewed and how women view themselves 
- women's consciousness had been altered by the war - they felt that they could do more than just be a house wife. this plants the seeds for women's rights movements

### March on Washington
- in 1941 A. Philip Randolph threatened the president that there would be a march on Washington if the president didn't pass legislation that broke down race decriminalization for wartime industrial jobs
	+ this provides a precedent for non-violent protests to work. first example of it

### Japanese interment
- After Pearl Harbor, US decides that all people of Japanese decent are deemed threats to national security and they're sent to interment camps
