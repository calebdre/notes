# Women's rights in the 1960s

> What were the 2 factors that led to the explosion of women's rights in the 1960s

### Why is it referred to as the second wave feminism
- the first wave was in the 1830s when they fought for the right to vote

### The second wave of feminism
- It was about complete equality under the law (education, jobs, etc.)
- Women combat the idea that they are subordinate to men in society
- women want a life outside of a home and the same professional opportunities
- women want more freedom in deciding what happens in their life

### Women before the 1960s
- 75% of women were in service industry jobs - jobs that were specific to women
- Women were restricted from doing a lot of things that they could in the 1920s

### Start of the feminism
- After the war, women don't need to go to 
- the economy is booming now, so women don't think that they need to go to college and work
- they're getting married younger and having more children, so they now need to stay home
- Because of all this going on, women are now portrayed as mothers and caretakers again - establishing heavy gender roles

### Factors in feminism
- Women's rights movement grows out of The Civil Rights movement 
- within the civil rights movement, there is a lot of sexism. There is a lot of assumptions that women are inferior to men

### The Feminism Mystique
- A book by Better Friedan
- she said that it is a myth that women are biologically inferior to men - it's a social construction
- the book caused women to be able to identify their frustrations. it helped raise their consciousness 
- the movement that it created (NOW), but it only appealed to white suburban women. Working class and minorities could not relate

### The personal is the political
- what happens to your body should be your decision
- birth control gave women the choice of when and for what reasons they have sex
- women advocated that abortion should be the choice of the woman
