# The New Modern Nation

### Aftermath of slavery
- In the aftermath of slavery, the south new needed cheap labor so that industry could resume again
- White southerners decided to start arresting people for lame charges to throw people into jails so that they can use convict labor
	+ convicts were treated worse because they didn't have value like the slaves did (slaves cost money, but you could just arrest people to get convict labor)
- The modern South was built on the backs of convict labor	
	+ railroads, steel, materials, etc. This work was done by convicts
- Slavery doesn't end after the civil war, it mutates

### Atlanta's rebirth
- Henry Grady (newspaper editor) was responsible for luring investors to Atlanta
	+ he wrote stories to encourage northern investors to come to the south
		* since the south was impoverished and was there and no one had money, investors could establish their dominance in a niche easily.
- Atlanta becomes the capital of Georgia 
	+ railroads bring in people and industry

### Racial tensions during the modern rebirth
- This new change also alters racial tensions
- there is a rising middle class of white and black people
- segregation laws
	+ black and whites live together more frequently, white supremacy begins to get called into question
	+ races and borders need to be redefined for the new generation
	+ interracial sex was a big problem to whites because white men lose control and masculinity 
- racial violence (lynchings and race riots)
	+ this was the result of the fears that black people would become equal to whites and white women would be attracted to black men
- 1906 Race Riot
	+ fears of black people would run wild in the streets of Atlanta, so newspapers generated hysteria about it and whites go and kill all the black people

### The Modern North
- the North came out of the was with lots of money
- they didn't have collateral damage. 
- the war made the north richer
- the war creates an explosion of wealth, which results in the creation of monopolies 
- Capitalism
	+ companies looking to increase their bottom line lobbies for easier restrictions on immigration so that immigrants can work cheaply for them.

### Immigration
- this was unique in 3 ways:
	+ the sheer number of the people coming in was the highest ever
	+ owners of industries recruit immigrants in their country to come to America
	+ before, northern and western Europeans and then Africans came, now they were coming from southern and eastern Europe
- as more immigrants came, Americans were concerned about their culture not being maintained
