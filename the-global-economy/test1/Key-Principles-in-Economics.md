#### Economics Defined
- The study of the allocation of resources
    + where resources are inputs of production (factors of production) (things we use to produce things - final goods)
- resources are scarce
    + which means every decision has tradeoffs or alternatives
- Resources include *land*, *labor* and *capital*

#### Opportunity cost
- the value of the next best alternative that we forgo when we make a decision
- explicit vs implicit
    + explicit: out-of-pocket expenditures
        * the tuition you pay to attend college is an explicit cost
    + implicit: hidden expenses
        * if you are attending college fulltime it precludes you from working fulltime and the money that you could have made while working is an implicit cost.

#### Marginalism
- comparing the cost and benefits of doing one additional unit of an activity.
- *Marginal Cost*: the cost of 1 additional unit
    + Example: what must we give up to hire one additional worker? (produce 1 additional unit)
- *Marginal Benefit*: benefits of 1 additional unit
    + Example: what is the overall benefit caused by production one additional unit of a good?
- *Economic decision Rule*:  if the marginal benefit is greater than the marginal cost, then one should pursue that activity; however, if the marginal cost is greater than the marginal benefit, then one should not pursue that activity


#### Incentives
- rewards and penalties that motivate behavior

#### Scope of Economics
- *Microeconomics*:  focuses on the individual decision-making agents such as the individual, the household, the firm and the industry.
    + deals with supply and demand of individual products/services
- *Macroeconomics*:  looks at the economy in its entirety. It deals with sums or aggregates.
    + deals with aggregate demand and supply and goods/services, consumer spending, inflation

#### Positive and Normative Economics
- positive:  seeks to understand behavior and the operation of systems without making judgments. It describe what is and how it works (objective)
- normative:  It analyses outcomes of economic behavior, evaluates them as good or bad, and may prescribe a course of action (subjective opinion)

#### Post Hox Fallacy
- pitfall that deals with correlation and causation.
    + just because to events happend to be correlated doesn't necessarily mean that ne has cause the other to happen.

#### Fallacy of composition
- just because it is true at a smaller level does not mean it is true at an aggregate level
    + Example: if i stand up in the class, I'll get a better view of the board. If everyone stands up, everyone can get a better view of the lecture

#### Vocab
- *Cateris Paribus*: holding other factors constand
- *Economic Equilibrium*: [picture](http://i.investopedia.com/inv/tutorials/site/economics/economics7.gif) (the place where functions intersect)
