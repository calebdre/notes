#### Markets
- place where buyers and sellers meet to buy and sell
- A competitive market is a market in which there are so many buyers and so many sellers that each has no influence over market price
- ***Monopoly***: where a single firm is the only supplier of a good/service
- ***Oligopoly***: where a few firms dominate an industry
- ***Monopsony***: where one firm dominates the purchasing of a good/service

#### Demand
- representes the quantities of a good that buyers are able and are willing to buy at those prices
- ***Law of demand***: we want to buy more of a product if the price is less
    + the higher the price, the less quantity demanded
- Factors that shift demand curve:
    1. Change in income
        + Normal vs Inferior goods
            - as our income increases, we'll purchase more normal goods and less inferior goods
    2. Change in the prices of related goods or services
        + complimentary goods vs substitute goods
            - complimentary goods: if increase in a, then increase in b
            - substitute goods: if increase in a, then decrease in b
    3. Change in consumer preferences
    4. Change in the number of consumers
    5. Consumer Expectations
        - if consumers know the price of iphones will increase in 3 months, demand will go up now

#### Supply
- represents a relationship between price and quantity
supplied
- ***Quantity Supplied***:  the amount of a good or service that producers or sellers are able and willing to put on the market for sale at a given price.
- ***Law of Supply***: When price increases, the quantity supplied increases, and when price falls, the quantity supplied decreases
- Factors that shift supply curve:
    1. Changes in the cost of inputs
    2. Advances in technology
    3. Taxes and producer subsidies
    4. Changes in the prices of related goods or services
        + compliments vs substitutes in inputs of production
    5. Change in the number of producer
        + number of produces increases, price increases
    6. Expectations

#### Supply & Demand
- [point of equilibrium](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f2/Simple_supply_and_demand.svg/2000px-Simple_supply_and_demand.svg.png)
    + where individuals would be better off taking other actions
- Quantity supplied = Quantity Demanded

#### Consumer and Producer Surplus
- ***Consumer Surplus***:  The difference between the maximum price a buyer is able and willing to pay for a product and the market price
- ***Producer Surplus***: The difference between the minimum price the producer is willing to accept for a good or service and the market price (the price the seller actually receives)
