    - *capital flows*:
        + foreign exchange currency restrictions (make it harder)
        + no bank deposits in other countries
        + foreign investment restrictions

Arguments for globalization
1. Increased wealth of nations (because all countries benefit from trade)  
2. Efficient production due to specialization  
3. Transfer of technology and knowledge  
4. Foreign direct investment increases employment  
5. Growing strength of the civil society  
6. Less possibility of war  
7. Increased cultural exposure  

Arguments against globalization
1. Increased income gap between the poor and the rich (benefits are not equally distributed   because of problems with the home country like corruption and nepotism)  
2. The growing power of multinational companies  
3. Increased competition can lead to a “race to the bottom”  
    - countries lower their conditions in order to provide a lower cost environment for international companies to be there and they compete with other countries
4. Adverse effects on the environment and working standards  
5. Loss of cultural identity  
6. Undesirable international flows
