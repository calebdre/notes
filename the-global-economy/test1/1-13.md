why more trade?
- Trade Costs
    + lower transport/communication costs
    + lower regulartory barriers to trade
        * free trade agreements, customs union (NAFTA, EU)
- harmonized rules to trade
    + so that businesses have to follow less rules from each country to trade
    + you don't need to customize your products to each country
- fewer trade disputes

Role of WTO
- not an enforcer of trade rules
- To bring countries together to negotiate trade agreements between them
- where members can resolve trade disputes
- forum of negotiation
