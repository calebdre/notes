### Calculating price index
- Letâ€™s calculate the price index in year 2012 using 2011 as the base year.
- The price index compares the price of the basket of goods in the current year (2012) with the price of the same (or similar) basket of goods in the base year (2011).
- Therefore, the price index in this hypothetical example is given by the ratio of total expenditure on the basket of goods in the current year to the total expenditure on the basket in the base year (normalized by multiplying by 100).
