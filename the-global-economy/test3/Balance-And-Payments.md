# Balance and Payments

### Introduction
- Real Sector: the sector in economy where production and sales of goods and services take place
- Financial Sector: sector in economy where transactions of financial assets take place	
	+ stocks (gov't or corporate), bonds, bank deposits

### Balance of payments
- it's a system consisting of several accounts:
	+ **Current Account**: those involving production and sale of goods, services, income, and unilateral transfers.
	+ **Financial/Capitol Account** those involving financial assets and liabilities (such as trades in securities or claims and liabilities of financial institutions and governments).
	+ **Other Capital Account** those involving non produced non financial assets.

### Double-Entry system of accounting
- The balance of payments accounting applies a common accounting system called the double-entry bookkeeping system.
- For any transaction recorded in the balance of payments accounts, two entries are made. Each entry is identified as either a credit or debit entry.
- A credit entry (+) in the U.S. balance of payments accounts is made when a transaction leads to a payment to a U.S. resident, company, or government by a foreign resident(s).
	+ inflows of funds is credit entry
- A debit entry (-) in the balance of payments accounts is made when a transaction involves a payment to a foreign resident(s) by a U.S. resident(s), business, or government. 
	+ outflows of funds is a debit entry
	+ net inflows = inflows - outflows

### Balance of payments identity
- The sum of all the credit entries and debit entries in the balance of payments accounts should be equal to zero by definition.
- In other words, the sum of the balances on the current account and the capital/financial account should be equal to zero. 
- This is the fundamental balance of payments identity.

### The current account
- The current account records international transactions in goods and services, income, and unilateral transfers.
- Transactions in goods comprise goods exports and goods imports.
- Transactions in services comprise services exports as well as services imports.
- Transactions in income comprise of income from factors of production, mainly labor and capital. These include wages, interests from holdings of financial assets such as bonds, dividends from holdings of stocks in private firms, as well as reinvested profits of multinational companies.
	+ Income receipts are income received by U.S. residents
		from foreign residents or entities.
	+ Income payments are payments to foreign residents by American residents, businesses, or government.
- CA = [Ex - Im] + [Income receipts - Income Payments] + net unilateral transfers (net inflows)
- Income receipts
	+ from providing labor wages
	+ from providing capitol (investments in stocks/bonds, bank deposits)
	+ income of multinational companies
- Unilateral transfers are essentially gifts or donations of goods and services.

### The financial/capital account
- The financial account records international transactions involving capital flows—sales and purchases of financial assets. For example, such assets include shares of stocks, bonds, bills, and certificates of deposits.
- Private assets include changes in privately-owned assets during the period under consideration. Private capital outflows represent the acquisitions of foreign assets by U.S. residents. Private capital inflows are investments in the United States by residents of other countries.
- Official reserve assets and other official (non-reserve) assets comprise transactions involving governments or agencies of governments such as central banks and treasury offices
	+ Central bank assets: Domestic gov't bonds, Foreign gov't bonds , foreign currencies, gold, IMF Instruments
- FA = inflows - outflows
- FA
	+ private capital flows
	+ Official settlements/reserves

### Other capital account transactions
- These are transactions in non-produced, nonfinancial assets of an economy.
- Examples
	+ Acquisition or disposal of right to tangible assets like right to mineral deposits and offshore drilling rights
	+ Transactions involving sales and purchases of intangible assets such as trademarks and copyrights
	+ Capital transfers related to payments for insured losses and debt forgiveness

Accounting balances
- The balance on current account (current account balance) is the sum of the balance on trade in goods and services, the balance on income, and the net unilateral transfers.
- Net financial/capital flows are obtained from financial/capital flows (inflows – outflows).
- The official settlement balance is the balance on the official reserve account.
- CA deficits can be financed by borrowing or sales of assets
	+ financial (private capital) inflows
	+ gov't borrowings (ex: seeling gov't bonds, borrowing from IMF)
	+ Seeling central bank's resered

### Current Account Balance
- C + I +G = domestic absorption
- CAB = current account balance
- Y = national income
