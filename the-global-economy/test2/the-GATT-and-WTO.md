# The GATT and the WTO

### Efforts to reduce trade barriers
- Countries try to reduce trade barriers because barriers to trade are inefficient.
    + they cause dead weight loss
- Some efforts
  + Multilateralism
  + WTO
  + regionalism
  + NAFTA, EU, etc.

### The GATT
- The General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) is a multilateral treaty originally signed by 23 countries in 1947 with the main objective of fostering freer trade.
- The GATT was not a full-fledged organization. Countries that signed the GATT were not referred to as “members” but
rather as “signatories.”
- The GATT established rules that governed international trade in goods but not services.
- By 1994 the number of the GATT signatories had risen from the original 23 to 128.

### The GATT and tariff reductions
- In the earlier years of the GATT, the focus was almost exclusively on reducing tariffs.
- To achieve progressive reductions in trade barriers, several multilateral trade negotiations were held under the GATT. These negotiations are commonly referred to as trade rounds.
- Trade rounds under the GATT lasted anywhere between less than a year and eight years.

### Dumping and anti-dumping measures
- Dumping refers to selling a good or service in another country (i.e., exporting) at a price below the cost of
production or at a price below the domestic market price.
- This is considered unfair trade because it puts producers in the importing country at a competitive disadvantage.
- The GATT rules aim to reduce or eliminate such “unfair” trading practices among its member countries.
- similar to export subsidy except a subsidy is regulated by the gov't but dumping is a business practice

### The WTO
- The World Trade Organization (WTO) was established at the conclusion of the last “trade round”
under GATT —the Uruguay Round—in 1994.
- The final treaty that established the WTO was signed in the Moroccan city of Marrakesh in April
1994.
- The WTO became operational in January 1995. Until this point, the GATT had guided the multilateral
trading system.
- The WTO is much more than simply a formalization of the GATT.
- The WTO was founded on a number of agreements including:
    + GATT 1994: This includes rules/agreements governing trade in goods (merchandise).
    + GATS (General Agreement on Trade in Services): This deals with rules governing international trade in services.
    + TRIPS (Agreement on Trade-Related Issues of Intellectual Property Rights): This deals with issues related to copyrights and patents.

### The WTO principles
- Trade without Discrimination: This principle of
  nondiscrimination takes two forms.
  + Nondiscrimination across countries:
    * The WTO ensures that countries do not discriminate among their trading partners. This is achieved through the most favored-nation (MFN) principle.
    * Under the most-favored-nation principle, if a country offers preferential treatment to one of its trading partners, it is obliged to offer the same treatment to all its trading partners.
    * One exception relates to countries that sign free trade agreements. Another exception involves benefits extended exclusively to less developed countries.

  + Nondiscrimination between foreign and locally produced goods:
    * Foreign and domestic goods should be given equal treatment in the domestic market. In other words, once a foreign product has reached the domestic market, there should not be a difference in treatment of such a product that is sanctioned by the authorities.

- Moving toward freer trade through negotiations:
    + Rounds of multilateral negotiations are regularly held under the auspices of the WTO (under GATT for earlier rounds).
    + The main focus of these negotiations is to reduce barriers to trade and gradually move toward a free flow of goods and services across countries.
    + The extent of success varies by round. The most recent round of negotiations, “The Doha Development Agenda,” ended in a disappointment.
    + However, since the inception of the GATT in 1947, barriers to trade have significantly fallen and trade volumes across countries have increased substantially as a result of multilateral negotiations

- Binding tariffs and transparency
    + When a country agrees to lower tariffs, it is important that the market considers such a move credible. Binding a tariff refers to a promise not to rise it in the future.
- Fair Competition
    +  This principle supplements that of nondiscrimination discussed above. The World Trade Organization rules are designed to ensure not only freer trade but also “fair” trade.
- Development and Economic Reform
    + the WTO rules recognize the difficult conditions faced by the least developed countries in implementing trade liberalization reforms.
### Export subsidy and countervailing duty:
- The imposition of an export subsidy by foreign government generates an increase in the quantity imported by domestic residents.
- WTO rules offer a remedy to the adversely affected (importing) countries by allowing them to impose a countervailing duty.
- A countervailing duty is a special type of import tariff intended to counter the unfair trade advantage resulting from a subsidy or other policies.

### The Doha round
- agreement tried to reduce argicultural subsidies, but countries relied on tariff revenue from agricultural exports

### Criticism of the WTO
- The WTO ministerial meeting in Seattle in November 1999
was met with massive protests by so-called anti-globalists.
- Those opposed to activities of the WTO activities make the
following arguments:
    1. The WTO encourages free trade, which in turn results in industries either closing down due to global competition or relocating to low-cost countries.
    2. Environmentalists have also come out against WTO’s mission to liberalize trade. They argue that free trade encourages mass production and transportation.
    3. Least-developed countries around the world have also not been happy with the WTO. Many look at WTO enforcement of intellectual property rights as unfair.
