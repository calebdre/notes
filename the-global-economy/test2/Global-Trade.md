#### Bilateral Trade
- trade between two countries
- Economically large countries tend to trade more with each other
- Large countries tend to have diverse resources to produce a variety of goods and services as well as large markets to import from other nations.

- tGravity equation of trade

#### Factors measuring Bilateral Trade
- Geography: geography can affect trade flows through its influence on accessibility.
- Cultural affinity: societies that share cultures, including language, have a higher propensity to trade with each other.
- Multinational corporations: multinational corporations account for a substantial portion of global trade and could explain some bilateral trade flows. 
- Government policy: government policy (discussed in Chapter 9) may impede or encourage more trade. A range of policy instruments such as import tariffs, import quotas, bureaucratic regulations of different sorts, and export subsidies all have substantial effects on bilateral trade flows.
- Trade agreements: free trade agreements (discussed in Chapter 10) establish preferential trading arrangements among participating nations. This typically takes the form of partial or total elimination of trade barriers among member nations. As a result, trade flows among member countries are expected to increase.
