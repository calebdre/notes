### Gross Domestic Product (GDP)
- defined as the market value of all final goods and services produced within a country in a given time period.
- A final good is an item that is bought by its final or end user.
- An intermediate good is one that is used in the production of a final good. Intermediate goods are inputs in the production of final goods.
- Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is a measure of a country’s output of goods and services
- Income = Total Expenditure
- GDP can be calculated three ways:
    + by adding up the value added of all producers (Value-Added Approach)
    + by adding up income paid to factors of production (Income Approach)
    + by adding up all spending on domestically-produced final goods and services (Expenditure Approach)

### GPD vs. GNP
- The “Domestic (D)” in “Gross Domestic Product” is there to underscore the fact that only final goods and services that are produced within a country count as part of that country’s GDP.
- So the output of the Japanese-owned Toyota Plant in Kentucky is part of the U.S. GDP, while the output of the American-owned General Motors Plant in South Africa is not part of U.S. GDP
- Gross National Product (GNP) measures the value of final goods and services produced by nationals (citizens) of a country and their resources.
- In the case of the output of the Toyota Plant in Kentucky, that would not be a part of U.S. GNP. However, the output of General Motors Plant in South Africa would be a part of United States GNP

### Measuring GDP: expenditure approach
- The expenditure approach involves adding up the values of all final goods.
- It can be expressed by the formula GDP = C + I + G + (X - M)
    + C is personal consumption or consumer spending
    + I is business investment (investment spending)
    + G is government purchases (infrastructure and facilities, but not not social handouts)
    + X - M is exports minus imports (i.e., net exports), trade balance.
    + C + I + G = domestic absorption
    + X - M = net expenditures by foreigners
- Consumer spending (C) is by far the largest component of U.S. GDP, accounting for roughly 70 percent of national
output.

### Limitations of GDP
- GDP is concerned only with new or current production.
- Sales of stocks and bonds are not counted in a country’s GDP.
- Goods and services not sold in the formal marketplace are not included in GDP.
- GDP may not be a very good measure of economic well-being of individuals in a country.
- GDP says nothing about income distribution.

### GDP per capita
- Economists often use GDP per capita to capture the economic well-being (standards of living) of people in different nations.
- GDP per capita is simply the GDP of a nation divided by that nation’s population. In other words, it is the average GDP per person.

### Nominal GDP vs. real GDP
- Nominal GDP is GDP stated in current year prices.
- Real GDP is nominal GDP adjusted for changes in prices.
    + The year for which the set of prices are chosen is called the base year and the prices from this year are called base year prices.
    + For example, let’s use 2009 as the base year.
- Nominal GDP is always equal to real GDP for the base year.
