[class notes](https://gsu.view.usg.edu/content/enforced1/892076-CO.090.ECON2100.11224.20154/Lecture8_TradeAgreements%20ECON2100.pdf?d2lSessionVal=O3LsBP7At8j1LUr8sgYEqD5F7&ou=892076)

### Stages of economic integration
- Preferential trade agreements
    + a nation grants partial treatments to one or more trading partners
- Free trade area
    + eliminates taridds and other trade barriers among member nations
    + ex: NAFTA, ASEAN
- Customs Union
    + has characteristics of a Free trade area
    + applies common rules to trade with non member countries
    + ex: EU under Treaty of Rome (1957)
- Common market
    + has characteristics of a Custom Union
    + has free movements of factors of production among member countries
    + ex: MERCOSUR
- Economic union
    + has characteristics of Common market
    + invovled some coordinating of economic policies amond member nations
    + ex: EU today (economic monetary union - the euro)

### Why countries pursue economic integration
- an increase in trade increases economic growth (measured in GDP/capita)
- a market goes up
- increase in competition increases efficiency
- increase in trade attracts foreign investments

### Success Factors of regional econimic integration?
- countries must have similar structures
    + similar languages and cultures
- close proximity to each other

### The effects of a free trade agreements
- **Trade creation** occurs when a country replaces high-cost domestic production with low-cost imports from a member country of a shared free trade agreement.
- **Trade diversion** occurs when low-cost imports from a nonmember country are replaced with high-cost imports from a member country to a shared free trade agreement.
- Ex: trade in wheat
    + before EU: Ireland imposed $5/unit tariff on imported wheat, so Ireland produced wheat domestically
    + Before EU: Ireland reduced tariff to $3/unit, so Ireland imports wheat from US
    + After EU: EU eliminates tariffs among member nations, so Ireland imports wheat from France
    + So, trade creation occurs as a result of the formation of the EU (Ireland starts trading with France), but trade diversion occurs because Ireland is not trading with US anymore, but with France

### Trade deflection and the rules of origin
- In the case of a free trade area (and not customs union), external trade policies are not harmonized. As such, there is a potential for non-member countries to circumvent the unfavorable treatment by shipping their goods to one of the member nations in a free trade area in order to gain access the entire free trade zone. This is called trade deflection.
- The rules of origin are legal provisions in preferential trade agreements specifying which goods will be eligible for preferential treatment under the free trade agreement treatment under the free trade agreement.
