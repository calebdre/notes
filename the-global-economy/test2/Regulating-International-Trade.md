#### Import tariffs
- A tariff is a tax imposed on goods traded across countries.
- An import tariff is levied on imports by an importing country.
    + Protectionism
    + Infant Industry Argument
        * infant industries can't compete with big corporations, so countries put import tariffs on to protect them.
- Effect of an import tariff:  is to increase the price of the good in the importing country
- A higher price is good for domestic producers but hurts domestic customers
    + Domestic production of the good increases while domestic
    consumption of the good falls.
    + The amount of imports decreases

#### Types of tariffs
-  ad valorem tariff:  fixed percentage of the value of imports. 
-  specific tariff: fixed amount of current units per unit of imports
-  combination (compound) tariff: combination of ad valorem and specific tariffs

#### Effects of import Tariffs
- increasing the price of the imported good in the country imposing the tariff
- A rise in price unambiguously hurts domestic consumers and benefits domestic producers
- The extent of the increase in the domestic price of the imported good for a given tariff depends on the relative influence of the country imposing the tariff on the global market for the imported product (a small country versus a large country tariff).

#### Small country tariff
-  small country: consumption and/or production cannot affect the world price of the good it imports. 
-  small country takes the world price of a good as a give
-  A forward-shifted tax is the portion of the tax paid by the buyer (added to the price paid by the buyer).
- A backward-shifted tax is the portion of the total tax paid by the seller (subtracted from the seller’s revenues).

#### Costs and Benefits of import tariffs
- Tariffs allow the importing government to increase its revenues.
- Domestic producers gain by charging a higher price than they would without the protection offered by the tariff, but consumers pay the higher prices.

#### Large Country Tariffs
- A large country is defined as one whose consumption and/or production of a good affects the world price of the good.
- A tariff imposed by a large country reduces the world price of the imported good. As a result of the tariff, the domestic price of the good increases.
- A higher price increases domestic quantity supplied and reduces domestic quantity demanded.
- The volume of imports (domestic quantity demanded – domestic quantity supplied) falls.

#### Non-tariff trade regulations
- **import quota** is a quantitative limit on the amount of a good that can be imported into a country. 
    + absolute:  limits the amount of a good that may enter the country in a given period of time, usually one year.
    + tariff-rate: allows a specified amount of a good (quota) to be imported into the country at a reduced tariff rate (could be zero percent tariff) and a higher tariff rate for imports exceeding the quota in a given quota period
- effects:
    + reduces the total supply of a good in the importing country
    + Given the demand for the good, reduced supply means a higher domestic price of the imported good.

#### Effects of an import quota
- Quota rent: additional revenues to holders of import licenses. When the domestic price of an imported good increase as a result of the quota, importers who hold import licenses collect a higher per unit price.
