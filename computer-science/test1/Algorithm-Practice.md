# 1/12 - Algorithm Practice

#### In programming alforiths, there are:
- instructions
- tasks performed
- well defined algorithm
- has a clear ending point

#### Qualities of an algorithm
- Inputs/Outputs should be clearly defined
- Steps should be clear and unambiguous
- Should be effective
- Should not have computer code

Examples:  
An algorithm to add 2 numbers entered by the user:
1. start
2. Declare input of num1, num2, and sum
3. Read in values for num1 and num2
4. Add num1 and num2 and assign the value to sum
5. print sum to the user
6. stop

An algorithm to find the largest among three numbers entered by the user
1. start
2. declare n1, n2, n3, and largest
3. read in values for n1, n2, n3
4. compare n1 and n2 to find the largest. assign the bigger number to largest
5. compare n3 to largest. assign the bigger number to largest
6. print largest to the user
7. stop

An algroithm to find the factorial of a number
1. start
2. take input
3. set factorial to input x
4. subtract 1 from x
4. set value of factorial to itself times x
