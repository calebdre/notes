#### Memory Cells
- Cell: a unit of main memory (8 bits, 1 byte)
- Most significant bit: the bit at the left end of the conceptual row of bits in a memory cell
- Least significant bit: the bit at the right end of the conceptual row of bits ina memory cell

#### Main memory Addresses
- Addresses: a number that uniquely identifies one cell in the computer's main memory
    + these numbers are assigned consecutively starting at zero
    + numbering the cells in this manner

#### 3 types of memory:
- RAM - Random Access Memory - temporary/dynammic
- ROM - Read-Only Memory - permenant/static
- DRam - Dynamic RAM

#### Memory Capacity
- Kilobyte: 2^19 bytes = 1024 bytes
- MegaByte: 2^20 bytes = 1,048,576 bytes
- Gigbye: 2^30 bytes

#### Mass Storage
- online vs. offline
- devices like CDs, DVDs, USBs
- larger, less volatile, slower than main memory

#### Files
- a unit of data stored in mass storage system
- Buffer: a memory area used for the temporary storage of data
