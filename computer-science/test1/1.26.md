Basic Hard units of a computer
- CPU is the brain
- ALU (arithmetic logic unit) does all the math and sends it back to the CPU
- Garbage in Garbage out (GIGO)

Boolean Operations
- an operation the manipulates one or more true/false values
- specific operations: AND, OR, XOR, NOT

Gates
- a devices that computes a boolean operation
- often implemented as small electronic circuits
- provides the building blocks from which computers are constructed
- VLSI (very large scale integration)

Flip Flops
- a circuit built from gates that can store one bit
- one input line is used to set its stored value to 1
- one input line is used to set its stored value to 0
- while both input lines are 0, the most recently stored value is preserved
