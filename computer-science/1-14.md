The role of a Algorithms
- An algorithm is a set of instructions that defines how to perform a task.
- A program represents an algorithm
- Programming is the process of developing a program
- Software are instructions
- Hardware is physical equipment

Early Computing Devices
- [*Abacus*](https://www.google.com/search?q=abacus&num=100&safe=off&espv=2&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ei=pbu2VLn_J4ScgwTavIGYCw&ved=0CAgQ_AUoAQ&biw=1680&bih=915): positions of beads that is used to represent numbers
- Gear Based machines
- Punch cards

**Computer Science allows you to be creative, it lets you discover and apply algorithms.**

How Computers Work
- Data: raw facts
- Computers are capable of accepting numbers, text, images, sound, and video as input

5 classic Components of a computer: Input Output memory Data controls

More precise Algorithms
- Well ordered sequence of instructions
- feasible operations
- takes finite time to so lve the problem

> Computer Science is the study of algorithms

The problem solving process
- identify the problem
- understand the problem (specifications)
- design the solution, which will be an algorithm
- implement the algorithm
- compile and execute the program

Bits & Bytes (check these)
- a bit is a 1s and 0s
- 1024 kilobites is a megabyte
- a byte is 8 bites
- a kilobite 2^10 bytes
- a megabite 2^20
- a gigabite 2^30
- a terrabite 2^40
