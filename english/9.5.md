# 9/5 
- Genre of argument in [geico commercial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XUpbS92WrLQ)
    + genre: commercial
    + the argument is that we should know that  fifteen minutes could save you fifteen percent or more on car insurance. 
    + the genre being a commercial gives it context
        * Because it is a commercial, the arguer can illustrate his point using a sort of skit like this. Whereas if the genre were a billboard, the way they tried to convey the message wouldn't be as effective, so they'd have to try some other form of entertainment/information. 
        * Genre = kind
        * Genre's have expectations and must be evaluated in a rhetorical analysis. 
            - they affect the context of the viewer
