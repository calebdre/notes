#9/9 - Frankfurt

### Chisholm Review
- humans have agent causal powers
- determinism states that events move linearly, however Chisholm states thats humans are agents that affects events


- **CDO** (could (ability to) do otherwise) compatible with determinism
	+ both assume **moral responsibility requires CDO**
	+ *Chisholm* says nope
		* in order to do otherwise, you have to be able to choose, so if determinism is true you can't choose otherwise
	+ *Ayer* says yes
	+ *Frankfurt* says **moral responsibility does not require CDO**
	
> PAP (principal of alternate possibilities) = CDO

### Frankfurt
- compatibilitist
- says moral responsibility does not require CDO
	+ it doesn't matter if a person could or could not have done otherwise
	+ What really matter is **what the person wants to do**  

- Revised PAP
> A person is not morally responsible for what she has done if she did or only because she could not have done otherwise
- example: gun to the head is not responsible, but the stubborn/cowardly person who will do it anyway is morally responsibility
- what the person whats decides if they are morally responsible or not. 
- Ayer and Chisholm arguments are misplaced - they argue about things that don't matter
- does not conflict with determinism
- we have 2 different desires 
	+ immediate - food/water
	+ second order volitions - desires about the kind of person we want to be (i want to be a certain kind of person)

- Both asks different questions:
	+ frankfurt asks when are we able to hold people responsible for what they did?
	+ ayer and chisholm asks
