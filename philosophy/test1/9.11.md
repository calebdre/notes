# 9/11 - the Deep Self (Wolf)

- determinism, hard determinism, compatibility, incompatibility, libertarian
- Susan Wolf : compatibilist  

#### Review
- Ayer - FW means CDO, and CDO is compatible with determinism
- Chisholm - FW means CDO , but CDO is **in**compatible with determinism, however humans have agent causal powers to affect events (which gives us free will)
- Frankfurt - Moral responsibility doesn't need CDO, so above arguments are invalid

#### The Deep Self View
> '**real**' self view

- **we have free will when our actions are coming from our *deep self***
    + Deep self is out character - who we really are on the inside
- deep self also rationally decides what kind of person we want to be in the future

#### Wolf  
> Jojo's deep self is insane

- jojo's deep self cannot see the good when it's right in front of him
- Jojo is not responsible for his actions.
- **the deep self view is missing something**
    + the deep self needs to be **sane** also
        * (So for free will, actions most come from our deep self *and* the deep self must be sane)

- Hard determinism (no one has moral responsibility): 'the basic argument'    

> what you do is because of who you are
 you didn't cause yourself to be who you are (those are caused by environment or genes)
 therefore, you are not responsible for what you do
