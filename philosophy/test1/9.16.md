### Free will review
- review key terms: *free will*, *moral responsibility*, *determinism*, *indeterminism* (given the past and laws of nature, there are multiple futures)
- Laplacean demon - person who knows the past and can therefore calculate the future
- [free will box](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1b/FreeWillTaxonomy2.svg/800px-FreeWillTaxonomy2.svg.png)
- traditional argument for incompatible:
     1. free will requires ability to do other wise, 
     2. determinism says that you cannot choose otherwise, 
     3. free will is incompatible with determinism
- ayer conflicts with determinism doesn't mean you can't do otherwise
- ayer's argument for compatiblism: 
    + an action was free if:
        1.  you could do otherwise if you wanted 
        2. your actions were voluntary
        3. no one coerced or constrained you
- Chisholm's argument for incompatibilism 
    1. in order to do otherwise, you must be able to choose otherwise
    2. if determinism is true, you can't choose to do otherwise
    3. therefore determinism is incompatible with free will
- Chisholm thinks humans have through will through being agents
    + agent vs agent causal powers 
- PAP
    + you had to have been able to do otherwise
- Frankfurt case
    + the ability to do otherwise is not relevant to your moral responsibility. hat is relevant is what you *want* to do
- Deep self view
    + you are morally responsible if actions come from your deep self (what you deep down want to do)
- Jojo's thought experiment 
    + we must have a sane deep self in order to be morally responsible. 
    + the sane deep self view
    + the sane deep self can tell the difference between the morally good and the morally bad
- Galen Strawson's Basic Argument
    + you do what you do because of who you are, 
    + you aren't responsible for who you are 
    + therefore you are not responsible for what you do.
