# 9/18 - Epistemology

- the study of knowledge
    + might all of our perceptions and sensations be some sort of illusion?
- belief vs knowledge
    + knowledge is a type of belief (knowledge is a subset of belief)
        * if jim knows his wife is cheating on him, he always believes it.
        * you can believe your wife is cheating on you, but you might not know it.  
    + what separates knowledge from belief? (what do you add to belief to get knowledge)
        * justification (proof)
        * truth
    + knowledge is *justified true belief* (JTB)
        * if you know P, then:
            1. P is true (the earth is round, not flat. early people did not know the earth was flat)
            2. you believe P 
            3. You are justified in believing P (you can prove P)
    +  Gettier Problems
        *  says that JTB is not knowledge
            - proof:
                1. a man told Jones that he will get the job
                2. jones goes to the interview and it goes really well
                3.  he reaches into his pocket and finds 17 cents 
                4.  jones doesn't get the job
                5.  the person that does get the job has 17 cents in his pocket
                6.  does jones have knowledge that the man with 17 cents will get the job?
            - objections
                + the language is not precise enough
        * externalism vs internalism
