# 9/4 [Free Will and the Self](http://www.informationphilosopher.com/solutions/philosophers/chisholm/freedom_and_action.html)

- ### Free Will Review 
	- Laplacian Demon
		* Dominoes
		* Time is a straight line
	- [Ayer and his argument](http://www.informationphilosopher.com/solutions/philosophers/ayer/freedom_and_necessity.html)
	 
- ### Chisholm
	- Answer to the problem of free will
		+ Free Will is **incompatible** with free will
		+ But humans **do** have free will 
		+ Hard determinist
	- Free will
		- 1. requires that we could have done otherwise
		   2. if one had chosen to do otherwise, one would have done otherwise
		   
		- Chisholm thinks Ayer thinks these 2 things are the same, but it's not true
			+ A man must be able to be choose to do otherwise
			+ just because one **could** do otherwise cannot mean the same thing as 'if one had chosen to do otherwise, then one would.'
	
	> - #### Ayer's Argument
		+ "Could have done otherwise" = "if one chose to do otherwise, then one would have done otherwise"
	
	> - #### Chisholm's counterargument:
		1. Free will means that one could have done otherwise
		2. In order to be able to do otherwise, it is necessary that one be able to choose to do otherwise. 
		3. Whoever, determinism means that one cannot chose to do otherwise
		4. Therefore, we are not justified in asserting that determinism is compatible with free will.
			
	- Determinism rules out choices. Everything is predetermined. You can't choose to do otherwise. 
	- It's two different things to say that you could **do** otherwise and saying that you can **choose** to do otherwise
	- Determinism and Free will are not compatible, however `we do have free will
	- transeunt vs. immenent causation (event vs. agent causation)
		+ events are the straight line time occurrences 
		+ humans are agents causing things to happen outside of original timeline
	- Determinism covers events `(event causation)`, humans with free wills are the agents that affect events `(agent causation)`
