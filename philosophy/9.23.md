###  External World Skepticism 

- Doubt everything that can be doubted
    + doubts the senses
    + then we can doubt that we have a body
    +  Descartes argues that you cannot doubt that you're doubting 
- mind-body problem (descartes)
    + there is a mind and body
    + but the mind is timeless and doesn't take up space and it doesn't change
    + the mind can exist independent of the body
    + **mind and body = radiowaves and radio**
