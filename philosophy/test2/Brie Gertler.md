### Disembodiment Argument
1. i can conceive of experiencing this very pain while disembodied
2. if i can conceive of a particular scenario occurring, then it is possible
3. so it is possible that this pain occurs in a disembodied being
4. if this pain was identical to some physical state, then it could not occur ti sine disembodied being
5. so this very pain is not identical to some physical state
6. therefore the identity thesis, which states that every mental state is identical to some physical state, is false
