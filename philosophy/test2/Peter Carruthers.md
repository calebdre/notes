# 10/14 && 10/16

## Peter Carruthers


>Answer  to the mind-body problem:
> - Reductive materialism. He calls it identity-theory, or that the mind just is the brain.

- Identity-theory argument
        1. Some conscious states and events are causally necessary for the occurrence of physical ones
                + if you don't have conscious states, you won't have physical one does not
        2. in a completed neuro-physiological science, there will be no need to advert to anything other than physical to physical causality 
        3. Therefore, some conscious states are identical with physical brain states and events
                + so the mind has to be physical

[Leibniz's Law](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TvxnQRzZYYs)
- Things are identical if and only if they share the same properties
- Things are not identical if and only if they do not share the same properties

Carruthers says to disprove that the mind and body are not the same through Leibniz's law

#### Objection 1
> 1. i may be absolutely certain of my own experiences
> 2. i cannot have the same degree of certainty about the existence of any physical state, including my own brain
> 3. there, by the law, my conscious experiences are not identical with my brain states

**this fails because it incorrectly applies the law. He uses the perception of the mind and body to prove it**

#### Objection 3 *(look at document from D2L)*
** disagree with second premise **

#### Objection 8 *(look at document from D2L)*
** how do you know that the mind doesn't take up space? (second premise) **

### Two Arguments
**The Closure Argument**
> 1. the only way a physical event can be caused to occur is by anotther physical event (call this closure of physical causation)
> 2. the mind can sometimes cause physical events to occur
> 3. therefore, the mind must be physical 

**The Identity Argument**
> 1. In order for two objects to be different, they must have different properties (Leibniz's Law)
> 2. The mind and the brain do not have different properties
> 3. therefore, the mind and the brain must be identical (the identity thesis)
> 

> ## Conclusion
>  there's good reason to believe identity thesis to be true and no reason to believe it false. so physicalism is true
