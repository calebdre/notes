- [Mary the super-scientist thought experiment](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge_argument)
    + if she learned something
        * not physicalist
        * the physical didn't change, but the mind did, so she learned something
    + if she did not learn something
        * physicalist
        * for the mind to change, the brain must change, but it didn't so she did not learn anything

- the philosophical zombie
    + if it is possible
        * dualist
        * you can have the brain outside without having the same mind
    + if it is not possible
        * physicalist
        * you must have the same mind if you have the same brain

### Thomas Nagel
- Answer to the mind-body problem
> Either some sort of dualism or duel aspect theory (although he doesn't completely rule out in physicalism)

- said if we can understand the brain well enough, we can know what's going on in the mind
-  does not avoid conciousness like otehr philosophers
    +  conciousness: there is something it is like to be there organism
- he says the reductionists accounts are premature because we don't understand enough about subjective experience nor physical stuff to even attempt to reduce it down to physical states
    + conciousness is necessarily subjective
- the objective vs. the subjective
    + objective is the way that things seem to you
    + subjective is the way we seem in the world and how we experience it
- perfectly understanding the objective means that we understand the subjective, however this is not true
- we can't experience what it's like to be a bat
