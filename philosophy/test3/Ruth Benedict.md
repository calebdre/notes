## Ruth Benedict 

- morality is no an independently existing thing, but rather something that is culturally bound. Things aren't right or wrong, but normal or abnormal, depending upon whatever culture one is in. 

- morality is what the culture believes at the time

## John Rachels

- cultures are not relative

#### Many Differences Argument
> 1. Different cultures have different moral codes
> 2. Therefore there is no objective truth in morality. Right and wrong are only matters of opinion and, opinions vary from culture to culture.

**Rachels says that the conclusion does not follow from the premise**  
In some societies, some people believe that the world is flat, and other believe that the world is round. It does not follow that there is no objective truth about the geography of the world. There is no reason to think that if there is moral truth everyone must know it.
