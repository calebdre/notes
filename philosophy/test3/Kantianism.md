Kant disagreed with utilitarianism
- Something is intrinsically good only if it never makes a situation morally worse.

- What is intrinsically good? according to Kant, it is good will. One cannot tell if someone has a good will either by examining their actions or the consequences of their actions (as someone may do the right thing for bad reasons)

- What is good will? a good will is a will of duty to the moral law. One is only said to be acting out of a good will if she is performing her action out of duty to the moral law

- What is the moral law? According to Kant it is the Categorical Imperative (CI) (What you do in every situation)
    + act only according to that maxim by which you could also will that would become a moral law
        * what would life be like if everybody did it?
    + act in such a way as to teat others as ends within themselves, and never as a mere means to an end.

1st CI
- If you don't think that it should be a universal law, don't do it.

2nd CI
- don't use people only as a means.
