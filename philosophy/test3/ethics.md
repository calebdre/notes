1. Cultural Relativism
    - very unintuitive 

2. Egoism
    - psychological
        + Humans always do what's in their best interest
    - ethical
        + What is good is whatever is in your personal best interest
    - problems
        1. How would society work if everyone were ethical egoists?!
        2. sometimes you don't know the best interest

3. Consequentialism 
    - when it comes to determining the morality of an action, one need only examine the consequences (the end justifies the means)
    - How to examine the consequences (Act consequentialism)
        + Maximum Act Consequentialism (MAC) - the moral action is the one which maximizes the good
        + Satisficing Act Consequentialism (SAC) - the moral action is the one that results in good enough consequences
    - Most consequantialists are **Hedonists**
    - Rule consequentialism 
        + you should follow the rules that will maximize happiness
        + gets around the 2nd and 3rd rules
        + imagine 2 worlds

> Act conseequentialism says whether you should or shouldn't do an act, but rule consequentialism tells you which rules you should follow 
> 
> Act Cs takes into consideration the act
> Rule Cs takes into consideration the rules

4. Hedonism
    - the only good is pleasure
    - the only bad is pain

5. Utilitarianism (John Stewart Mill)
    - "The greatest happiness for the greatest number of people"
    - Utilitarians are **MAC + Hedonism**, so they think the moral act is whatever act results in the greatest amount of happiness for the greatest number of people
    - ** We should do what's in the best interest of everyone instead of just one person**
    - Difference between Utilitarianism and Consequantialism
        + the view of what is "good"
            * utilitarians says that "good" is happiness, and Consequentialism has not given a stance on what is "good"
    - Higher happiness vs lower happiness
        + lower: Bodily happiness, sex, etc.
        + higher: self-actualizing pleasures (reading, listening to music)
            * we should maximize this kind of happiness
    - Arguments
        + it takes into consideration happiness instead of humans. It is more concerned with happiness and not humans
        + it mixes up what other people are allowed to do with themselves and what you are allowed to do with you
        + How would you know what the consequences are if you can't see into the future 

6. Deontology
    - not consequentialism 
    - when determining the morality of an action, you look at more than just the consequences. Look at the act itself
        + rule, rights and, obligation based ethics
    - 3 kinds
        + Divine command theory
            * hated by Plato and Socrates
            * follow rules that the gods told you to follow
            * euphario dilemma
                - is it good because the gods say to do it or did the gods say to do it because it was good
                    + if it's good because the gods say to do it, they could alter the rule tomorrow, making morality fickle
                    + if the gods say to do it because it's good, why do we need the gods?
        + social contract
            * right or wrong is determined by the social contract (an agreement of what to do and not to do to each other)
            * Hobbes: People are naturally evil, so we should live under a leviathan (powerful government) to enforce the contract
            * Locke: people are good, so we need a night watchman type person
        + kantianism
7. Virtue Ethics
    - Neither of the last two talk about the actor. If a cop pulled you over, then fine. But if a civilian did, it would be weird.
    - not concerned with actions/consequences, but rather with the character of the moral agent
    - Humans should cultivate the moral virtues (generosity, compassion, courage...) and avoid forming moral vices (covertness, hated, cowardice)
        + Cultivate the virtues by practice (the more you practice honesty, the more honest you become)
    - VE is not primarily concerned with action, but you must do the right thing for the right reasons
    - The goal is eudaimonia, or human flourishing. a sign of a life well lived. We should emulate virtuous people (Mother Theresa, Jesus)
    - we should have just enough virtuous traits
        + not enough bravery, you're a coward. Too much, then you're reckless.if you have just enough, you are courageous. 
    - **Aristotelian Moral Virtues**
        + Courage, Temperance, Magnanimity , Patience, Wittness, Friendliness, Modesty, Righteous anger

> The Doctrine of Double Effect
> It's okay to do a good action even if it has bad consequences if the act itself does not bring it about.

> e.g. civilians being killed in a war
