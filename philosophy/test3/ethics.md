1. Cultural Relativism
    - very unintuitive 
2. Egoism
    - psychological
        + Humans always do what's in their best interest
    - ethical
        + What is good is whatever is in your personal best interest
    - problems
        1. How would society work if everyone were ethical egoists?!
        2. sometimes you don't know the best interest

4. Consequentialism 
    - when it comes to determining the morality of an action, one need only examine the consequences (the end justifies the means)
    - How to examine the consequences
        + Maximum Act Consequentialism (MAC) - the moral action is the one which maximizes the good
        + Satisficing Act Consequentialism (SAC) - the moral action is the one that results in good enough consequences
    - Most consequantialists are **Hedonists**
        + the only good is pleasure
        + the only bad is pain

3. Utilitarianism
    - "The greatest happiness for the greatest number of people"
    - Utilitarians are MAC + Hedonism, so they think the moral act is whatever act results in the greatest amount of happiness for the greatest number of people
    - ** We should do what's in the best interest of everyone instead of just one person**
    - Difference between Utilitarianism and Consequantialism
        + the view of what is "good"
            * utilitarians says that "good" is happiness, and Consequentialism has not given a stance on what is "good"
    - Higher happiness vs lower happiness
        + lower: Bodily happieness, sex, etc.
        + higher: self-actualizing pleasures (reading, listening to music)
            * we should maximize this kind of happiness

4. Deontology
5. Virtue Ethics
