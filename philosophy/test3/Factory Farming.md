## Factory Farming

**Alexander Norcross**
- Argues against factory farming
- If you endorse factory farming, you endorse puppy torturing
> 1. if it's wrong to torture puppies for gustatory pleasure, then it's wrong to support factory farming
> 2. it's wrong to torture puppies for gustatory pleasure
> 3. therefore it's wrong to support factory farming

Differences between factory farming and puppy torture:
1. fred is personally doing the torturing we are not personally doing the factory farming

2. Fred knows that the torturing is happening, but most us don't know what's going on with factory farming *(needs to be different in the things, not us)*

3. if fred gave up chocolate, he would no longer torture puppies. however, if i give up meat, the factory farms will still continue to operate. (just because it doesn't solve all of the problem doesn't mean it doesn't solve some of the problem, which is just as good)

4. the doctrine of double effect. fred tortures and kills the puppies for the intended purpose of fred's gustatory pleasure. factory farming is an unintended side-effect of a system that is made to satisfy the gustatory pleasure of others. it is unintended (it doesn't apply here. it *is* intentional)

5. puppies are different than pigs, chickens, etc. it's wrong to do it to puppies, but not wrong to do this to pigs, chickens, etc. (the reason that it's wrong is because the animal is aware and they suffer)

2 Types of reasoning:
- Modus Ponens
    + if P, then Q. 
    + P. therefore, Q
- Modus Tollens
    + if P, then Q
    + not P. Therefore not Q

1. If i's wrong to torture puppies for gustatory pleasure, then it's wrong to support factory farming.
2. it's not wrong to support factory farming
3. therefore it's not wrong to torture puppies gustatory pleasure 

Argument for modus Ponens:
    1. Argument from Marginal Cases
        * we have to set a bar for human morality. Some people will be below the bar, and some animals will be above it. So we shouldn't set a bar because of marginal cases
    2.  Moral Agents and Moral Patients
        * animals are moral patients (things that are target to moral obligations but cannot give them back. if it can suffer, then it is a moral patient)

Speciesism
- thinking that you have no moral obligation to animals because you aren't a part of their species.
