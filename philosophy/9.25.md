     + Descartes doubts everything except the fact that he's doubting
        * "the dream" thought experiment
            - could life be a dream?
            - that means the senses are lying
        * "the evil demon" thought experiment
            - reality is wrong because a demon is making you experience what you do, not what's actually there
        * which means **he** definitely exists
        * this is *"the pit"* (the only thing that exists is your own mind)
            - solipsism
        *  the way out of the hole
            1. he has a strong inclination to believe that his sense reliably tell him that there is an external world
            2. god must have created me with this strong inclination
            3. suppose that the external world does not exist
            4. if 3, the God must have deceived him
            5. God is not a deceiver
            6. therefore 3 must be false, the eternal world must exist

    + terms
        * sense-data: the things that immediately known in sensations (colors, sounds, roughness)
        * sensation - the experience of being immediately aware of sense-data
        * physical objectL the thing which we are having/receiving the sense-data about
        * matter: the collection of a physical object
    + views of reality
        * *physicalIsm* (materialism)
            - everything that exists exists as the physical
            - scientific materialism
        * *idealism*
            - everything exists in the mind of god
        * *dualism* - mind  and physical exists, and the two are separate but interacting substances
        * *solipsism* - one's own mind is the only thing that one can know for certain exists
    + way out of the pit
        * the way of doubt is valid
        * appeal to the best possible explanation
            - we can tell something exists because everyone can agrees that  it exists
            - public object (the table) vs private objects (the table perceived by us)
        * the outside world exists because there is no good reason for rejecting it, there's no proof there there is none
