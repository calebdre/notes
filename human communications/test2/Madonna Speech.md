## [Madonna Speech](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4aQatsyz-Q)

#### Look for:
- logos
	+ he's talented (he's a legend)
	+ Background (lack of childhood)
- pathos
	+ no childhood
	+ idolizations
	+ he's a human being (we can still relate to him)
	+ crotch grabbing w/ her children
- ethos
	+ she knew michael personally
- rhetor
	+ Madonna
- artifact
	+ Youtube video of speech from a broadcasted video on MTV
- exigency
	+ michael jackson's death
	+ the prosecution and accusation of michael
		* she made the speech to shift the mindset of him from child molesor to king
- rhetorical situation
	+ Agent
		* Madonna
	+ Act
		* Message
			- importance of michael jackson
		* Medium
			- youtube video of broadcasted speech
	+ Scene
	+ Audience
		* fans of Michael Jackson
		* crowd
		* awards show crowd
		* family
		* youtube video audience
		* us

- What rhetoric does
	+ names
		* he's a human being and a king
	+ empowers
		* to clear michael's name
	+ enlarges
		* associates him with being a human being
		* associates him with positivity
		* disassociates him with being a child molestor
	+ elongates
		* immortalizes michael
		* through using her kids as an example
		* through her looking up videos online of michael dancing
	+ distracts
		* from our attention of other things and brings it to MTV
	+ unburdens
		* she's consoling the grievers
		* thought she could make a decision

- Art
	+ cooperative
	+ temporary
	+ limited
