## Argumentation

It is a form of persuasion

It is based on a set of **criteria** 
- A beauty pageant
    + winners may be judged on poise, talent, appearance, etc. All criteria

There is a **critical decision**
- we have to apply the criteria, then we must make the decision 

Reason also comes into play. The decision must be **reasonable** 

We ask the question if the critical decision was reasonable based on the criteria

** Reason is not reasonable **
- it depends on the cultural background
- we are not always reasonable and rational creatures

Pluralistic ignorance
- when the majority goes against the rational and it's hard to go against what they say is true

Starting points for being reasonable 
- language
    + we have to understand what the other person is saying
-  fact
    +  we need to have the same fundamental and basic premises that we can argue
- presumption
    + we have to assume the same things 
- commonplace
    + we have to have something in common that we can argue from

## Argumentation Model (pg. 370)
Starts with a claim  
needs grounds (support)  
conclusion (beginning with since and ties with support and ends with claim)  
backing - takes in the support and makes it have clout (specific/official statistic, support)  
qualifiers -  persistence (always, sometimes, in certain situations)  

Rebutle - other person does the above steps     
reservation - a qualification of other claim that answers the other claim
