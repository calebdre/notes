## Visual Communication

- Three ways to
    + Iconicity (it acts as a symbol)
        * images can evoke emotional responses or can stand for something else
        * it can accentuate features
        * they're able to create a volatile reality, or a reality that does not exist
    + Indexicality (seeing is believing)
        * images can lie to us
    + Syntactic Indeterminacy
        * images lack a concreteness (there are always many ways to interpret images)

Art (is) Persuasion
- There is no pure form of entertainment

The paintbrush is mightier than the sword
