## Political Communication

Journalism
- aim to be objective
- problems for objectivism
    + personal beliefs
    + balance of types of ethos (racism)

Media Elite

Media is capitalistic

Formulaic nature of news
- there's a repeated accepted way of reporting news
- the most important things might be missed

- there's always news to be reported in the world
- we always want new news, so news is reported or created
